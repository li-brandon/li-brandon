<h1>Welcome! 👋</h1>

   My name is Brandon Li and I'm a recent Finance and Computer Science graduate from Washington University in St. Louis 🐻.

I'm currently working as an Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments in Westlake, TX. My work centers around reducing trading costs and increasing alpha capture for OPEX, an AI model-driven automated trading system.

You can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or email me at librandon0706@gmail.com.
